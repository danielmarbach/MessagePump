and finally, depending on how mych time more you want to invest in that talk, I would add a short section about connecting the pump and the sender i.e. how to you pass the transaction context through the user code so that if you send a message in a handler, it uses the same transaction as the pump created

- Add to the send via part

then there is the batching part. In the beginning you say that sender code is easy and you won't be talking about it
but then you spend some time talking about batching
which is arguably about the sender code
so you might replace that statement with saying "I'll explore the challenges lurking in the sender implementation later"
or skip the batching if you need to save more time

OK. I think I would skip the Pub/Sub part that is towards the end of the talk
to save some time
it is not essential to the whole story and I am worried it could be overwhelming for the not-so-experience devs
and make the monitoring part shorter
